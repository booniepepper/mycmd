#+TITLE: MyCmd

Notes and Plans

* MyCmd Execution Wrapper
** Enhancements
*** TODO Add =--debug= flag that sets =MYCMD_DEBUG= environment variable before calling script
*** TODO Add =--trace= flag that sets =MYCMD_TRACE= environment variable before calling script

* MyCmd Shell Library
** Design Questions
*** Need to think through startup deferreds
In my current implementation, I am using it for use within the evaluation of =mycmd-lib=.

What about using it from user-written MyCmd libraries? Do I need to add special
context to make sure the list of commands to run is specific to a given library?

*** mycmd-lib organization
I need to think of logical ordering of the function groups in the file.

*** Division between the MyCmd Execution Wrapper and the MyCmd Shell Library
Which things belong in which?

For example, should the execution wrapper set common environment variables?

*** MYCMD_BIN
Can I have the values be function names instead of paths?

*** Runtime analysis

Can I enable something to validate that I am not leaking environment variables
in my implementation at all?

** Enhancements
*** TODO Use xdg environment variables and commands when on Linux
*** TODO Set up trap, tracing, and clean up functions
*** TODO Add convenience methods for logging to files
*** TODO Add support for specifying colors by number
*** TODO Add support for other terminal handling routines
**** [ ] clearing the terminal
**** [ ] setting cursor position
**** [ ] deleting characters
**** [ ] emoji support
*** TODO Allow the output functions to accept input from pipes
*** TODO Add optional parameter to =mycmd.log_function= for file to log to instead of stderr
*** TODO Add optional parameter to =mycmd.log_function= for the name to use in logging the function
*** TODO Create convenience functions for using and capturing output that needs to be processed multiple times
*** TODO Check for terminal capabilities before adding to associative arrays
*** TODO Handle commands with dashes in the name in MYCMD_BIN
*** DONE Have _MYCMD_DEFERRED_STARTUP be library specific
     I would have to generate a variable name. I think the best thing to do
     would be =_MYCMD_DEFERRED_STARTUP_<HASH>= with that Hash being the sha1 of
     full path of the library.

     Using indirect variables proved to be too complicated, so I went with a
     simpler route.
*** TODO =mycmd.log= and related functions should handle multi-line input better

** Implementation
*** =mycmd.get_named_temp_file=

** Resources
*** Setting Colors and Not Forking a Lot

I should adapt this example into my code:
